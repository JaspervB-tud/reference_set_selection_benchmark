    "**NOTE**: we assume that the groundtruths are known since we base our results on simulations. In this, we assume that the user has access to a file for every sample called `sample_sampleid_groundtruth.tsv` located in the corresponding sample folder. These groundtruth files are provided on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14727633) for the experiments (folder structure: groundtruth_reads_SARS-CoV-2/Proximity-America_baseline/$abundance/$sample/groundtruth.tsv) in our manuscript and have for every line a lineage followed by the relative abundance."
